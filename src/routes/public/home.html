            Why recreate the dashboard? [Click Here]

            <p>
              A lot of reasons actually, but it all came down to doing more maintenance than actual feature development.
              <br />
              <br />
              The dashboard was going pretty well, until I was requested to add discord integration,
              routinely checked APIs, and other asynchronous jobs. I had built the dashboard on the premise that it would
              be simple, there would be a "trigger" for all events, and everything could be done synchronously.
              Unfortunately, that is not what was going to be needed.
              <br />
              <br />
              When I needed to add discord integration, that part was async only. So I had to forcibly "monkey-patch" in
              a way to use the synchronous dashboard with the asynchronous discord bot. This worked "well", except I now
              had the overhead of the new redis instance. I then tried to add on celery on top of that redis instance so
              I could support message queues and routine tasks like api checks. This was ok too, but even small
              adjustments to celery would break the stack. Final nail in the coffin was when marketeers would get
              multiple pings in a row for the same order.
              <b>Still to this day, I still don't understand why this was</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Being the sole developer and hating the asynchronous code I cobbled together into a synchronous system,
              I took a break for a couple of months. Eventually, I got bored while I was deployed in Taiwan,
              and went back to what I liked best: coding with new technologies and creating features instead of
              doing overbearing maintenance. Don't get me wrong. I do maintenance when needed, but doing it all the time
              by myself without being able to find the root cause was painful.
              <br />
              <br />
              The "Idea"(c) is to create the dashboard again from the ground up, assuming everything will be
              asynchronous. In fact, this was one of the design focuses for Node.js when it was created.

            Does this mean we'll have to do this all over again at a moments whim?

              If I was being overly serious and cynical, I'd say <b>yes</b>. This is what you get when you have
              a single developer who does this FOR FUN (weird, I know). You can't expect me to give this Long-Time Support
              and I have been known by many to be fickle and never buy-in to any of my development projects. I'm doing this
              for fun, and once it starts feeling like work, I'll stop. I work as a test engineer who has to debug
              assembly or program problems and do maintenance at work already. I don't need two times the headache.
              <br />
              <br />
              If I was being realistic about it, i'd say hopefully not. I'll do my best to prevent having to rebuild
              the entire dashboard all over again, but being the sole developer for as "large" as a project as this
              is, while fun, kind of rough. In fact, I built the stack in javascript hoping there would be SOMEONE who was
              interested in helping. As Javascript is the only language you can use in a browser, web developers should
              be familiar with it.
              <br />
              <br />
              Using the over-cliche type of deal, I put a lot of time and effort because I find it fun. If I can use my
              enjoyment to make the everyone in the corporation lives easier, then it is my honor.

            Did you just say APIs are dead?
          </div>
          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              Yes. You heard me right. <b>APIs are dead.</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              APIs have always been a thorn in my side. They can expire, other sites can steal them, people don't
              remember which APIs correspond to different groups, people use APIs in more than one place,
              what is a "full" API changes when CCP adds extra scopes, getting an API is "too challenging"...
              <br />
              <b>Enter CREST</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Now that crest (SSO) authentications can access the XML api, the old API system is no longer needed.
              People don't have to go through a complicated process to create them, you don't have to ensure the API is
              not expired, and sites can't use other site's CREST authentication. If I need a new set of permissions
              from you, I'll just get it when you click that "Log In" button again.
              <br />
              <br />
              "That's great and all, but I don't care about developers. What does this mean for me?". Well for starters,
              you don't have to create an API. Literally click the dashboards "Log In" button, sign in, choose a character,
              and click authorize. This is as simple as it gets.
              <b>If you can't even do that, I don't understand how you even sign in to EVE.</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Here's a caveat though. CCP decided that you cannot submit a "full account" CREST auth. This means you will
              need to click a couple of buttons for EVERY character that you own. I get it. It's pretty annoying if you
              have 8 full accounts. At least you don't have to go sign in, create the correct API key, sign out, sign in
              with the next one, create another correct API key, sign out... you get the picture.

            What about migrations?

          <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
              ...this one is a little painful. Long story short, I hope to be able to get the discord auth associations
              and be able to tie your new dashboard accounts with your old forum accounts. If not, you won't be able to
              edit your old responses on the dashboard (data will definitely still be there) and I'll need to force
              everyone to update their discord associations on first log-in.
              <br />
              <br />
              The discord API, being an annoying piece of "unappetising food", I wouldn't be surprised if I couldn't migrate
              that. Discord integration will hopefully be deployed in the near future, but not immediately. I would just
              like to say that it will be much easier for me this time around though.
